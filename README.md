#### Comparison-of-Association-Rule-Mining-Techniques-In this experiment, we compared two association rule mining tools applied to four different datasets, covering various domains such as retail, credit, and e-commerce. The objective was to compare the performance of the two algorithms and record the time complexity of each method. The subsequent sections of this report will introduce the data processing methods, the distinction between the association analysis algorithms, and the brute-force approach. Following that, we will present the results of the experiments conducted and compare the performance of the two methods in the context of association rule mining tasks. Finally, we will summarize the findings of this experiment and provide recommendations for future research..
